# uniq

	Like GNU uniq, but does not require the input to be already **sorted** and does not  have **memory leaks**
    performs **slightly** faster than the GNU version and is wayyyy smaller than the GNU version.

 # TODO
 	1. Lots of testing (mmm maybe)
 	2. Performance bench marks (In Progress)

 # Build
 	Just run ./build.sh [debug|small|fast]

 # Running

		set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include libfolder

 # Note
 		Please feel free to send bugs, memory leak reports at **maqsood3525@live.com**
